    "We've chosen the heart failure prediction dataset to analyze for our first data set. So someone who would read our data analysis for the most part would be professionals in the healthcare industry such as doctors or nurses, these attributes within the dataset help indicate signs that a person could have heart failure in the future. Attributes like cholesterol and blood sugar could aid healthcare workers in being more precise and help determine whether this individual needs an ultrasound or blood test. This is very useful in general because using the quantitative data can be used much more earlier compared to the chronic symptoms like lightheadedness and heart rythm changes, using the quantitative data will help to execute actions much quicker.\n",

    "Police shootings in the United States have sparked intense discussions about law enforcement, racial disparities, and the use of force. This report explores data on fatal police encounters using the shootings dataset, which records incidents of individuals shot and killed by police officers across the country. By looking at factors like race, gender, age, mental illness, and whether the person was armed, we hope to uncover patterns and better understand the circumstances surrounding these tragedies. This dataset may be dissected and scrutinized by detectives, higher officials, or research students seeking to uncover insights on research articles. It is a public dataset and for a topic that helps the general public understand trends on police shootings. Attributes/features such as race, age can help how demogrpahic factors may play a part in this dataset, while attributes like the existance of mental illness can provide other insights on the nature of these shootings. The relationships drawn from this dataset can potentially link bias or prejudice of some level therby aiding in the implementation of policies by individuals looking to make change."
